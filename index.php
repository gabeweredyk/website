            <p>
                My name is Gabe and I am a senior in highschool looking to pursue a higher education in mathematics. I strongly believe in the sentiment that education should not be thought as a competition, but rather an ability for one to answer questions about the world around them. Since education is fundamentally inquiring about the world around us, I believe it is my duty to pose the questions in an inticing and accesible matter through the marvelous medium of the internet.
